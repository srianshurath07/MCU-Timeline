# The MCU Timeline
Stage 1: Static Skeleton
Description:
This is the foundational HTML structure for a MCU Timeline App. This app will provide a timeline of all the primary events in the MCU starting from the first appearance of Eternals on Earth to the latest developments as it goes on.

The purpose of this stage is to define the core layout and semantic structure before dynamic content and styling are added.

Included Elements:

- Header: Contains the app title, a cover and a button for theme toggling (light/dark mode).
- Navigation (nav): Placeholder for future filter or sorting controls.
- Main Section: Hosts the timeline container where event markers will be dynamically rendered.
- Modal: Empty div reserved for future pop-up/modal interactions.
- Semantic HTML: Uses modern HTML5 tags like `<main>`, `<article>`,`<section>`, and `<header>` for accessibility and clarity.
